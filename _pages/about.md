I am an urban scientist with a creative passion for design, poetry, and songwriting. 

Professionally, I succeed at synthesizing complex data into actionable insights, leading interdisciplinary teams, and working on data-driven/informed products and projects. With a foundation in urban data science, physics, and urban planning, I thrive at the intersection of technical depth and real-world application. I am eligible to work in both the United States and the European Union.
